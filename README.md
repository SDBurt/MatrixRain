# MatrixRain

A P5.js program that imitates the matrix. This code was based on the tutorial called ```Guest Tutorial #4: Matrix Digital Rain in p5.js with Emily Xie``` by ```Codetrain```, with a few tweeks to spacing, speed, and colour.

This tutorial and others can be found at the Codetrain youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S1TQCi9axzg&t=1936s

Thanks.
